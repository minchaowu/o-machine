This construction is based on Harrison's construction of plain machines. The following features are added to carry out the relativized computation:- An oracle tape, which is represented by a function from integers to {One, Blank}.- A halting stage, which allows users to limit the steps of computations.- A use function to trace the usage of oracle tape.Other conventions of oracle machines follow Soare (1987).To get started, load the code into OCaml's toplevel:    # #use "oracle machine.ml";;Write a function to define oracle tape, for example:    # let oracle x = if x = 2 then One else Blank;;Write an o-machine program with the command form of **(current state, oracle, symbol) |-> (next state, action, direction)** by replacing the following command set in the list with your own one:    # let prog = itlist (fun m -> m)    [(1,One,One) |-> (1, One,Right); (1,Blank,One) |-> (1, One,Right);    (1, One, Blank) |-> (2, Blank, Left); (1, Blank, Blank) |-> (2, Blank, Left);    (2,One, One) |-> (3,Blank,Left); (2,Blank, One) |-> (4,Blank,Left);    (3,One, One) |-> (3, One,Left); (3,Blank, One) |-> (3,One,Left);    (3,One, Blank) |-> (5, Blank,Right); (3,Blank, Blank) |-> (5, Blank,Right);    (5,One, One) |-> (0, One,Left); (5,Blank, One) |-> (0, One,Left);    (4,One, One) |-> (4,Blank,Left); (4,Blank, One) |-> (4,Blank,Left);    (4,One, Blank) |-> (0,Blank,Right); (4,Blank, Blank) |-> (0,Blank,Right);]    undefined;;Now run the program with **exec** *prog* *inputlist* *oracle* *stage*:    # exec prog [2] oracle 100;;    result = 2    use = 4- : unit = ()If we view the oracle as the halting problem ***K***, then the above **prog** defines the function f(x):= if x belongs to ***K*** then x otherwise 0.Since any oracle we can define here is computable (by writing down the algorithm explicitly), real-world o-machines seem to be no stronger than plain Turing machines. However, if there exists a truly random binary string, then this program may return you another one.
